# breast_cancer.py

--> In this project I use breast_cancer dataset of sklearn to build a model that predicts whether a person has breast cancer or not.
I use LogisticRegression for modeling and do hyperparameter tunning using GridsearchCV.
Model accuracy is around 0.96.

# used_car_price_pridiction.py

--> In this project I use used car data to predict the price of it. In that, I made functions for remove_outlier, data preprocessing, and model building and added comments when necessary.
Ans I use linearRegression model to train despite it underfitting the data but the main intention of preparing this project is to build an understanding of coding structure or  project structure
